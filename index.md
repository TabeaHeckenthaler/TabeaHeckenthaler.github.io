## Lecture 3 Nov 9th:
* use Slack!
* We need to do the homework... Checking some webpage
* How to create stuff in flask: Every computer has a number (IP number)
* Every computer calls himself (127.0.0.1) ...
* Google.com is actually just a number, connecting to 'googles computer'
* Build a search engine with some data from your research (work in pairs!!)
* FLASK: uses jinja (some computation in python, templating engine, like email with 'Hi, firstname')
* install flask, it will create routing map (answers to specific requests and returns a route?)... 
* @app (decorator, changes the behaviour of the decorated function)
* seperate code and data
* map some address to some function
* on Windows (windows command line): <br />
set FLASK_APP=app <br />
set FLASK_DEBUG=1 <br />
flask run

* debug mode makes dynamic updates when I change my python file
* browser, application is running, editor
* Run flask from the command line, it creates a routing map locally on your computer and it waits for someone to ping to your computer
* You have to install pytest in your environment
* If you turn off the computer, no one would be able to access, because flask is not waiting for anyone to ping to your computer from the browser.
* when you open a website you temporarily store the html, this is already downloading
* SSH client: connect to WEXAC terminal using Putty or MobaXTerm
* You can use the requests package to access any website... scraping
* To prevent that computers pretend to be humans... like with the requests website, they ask you to click the watermelon
- [ ] Write a calculator 
- app.logger... can help you deal with errors in your website\
- pull request with a link in your json files (homework)
